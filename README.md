#### Variable Declaration Notes

- Variables must first be initialized with the ':=' operator
- We can initialize a variable outside of a function, we just can't assign a value to it.
- Variable can be initialize and assigned with the ':=' operator
- To reassign the value of an operation you use the '=' operator

#### Function Declaration

- Every function that returns a value must indicate what type of value it is returning.(ex. string, bool, int, float64)
- Files in the same package can freely call functions defined in other files. Without having to import.

##### Slices and Arrays

- Array: fixed length list of things
- Slice: Array that can grow or shrink
- Every element in a slice must be of the same type
